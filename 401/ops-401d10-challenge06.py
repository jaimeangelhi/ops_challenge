if name == "main":
main() # Execute the main function if the script is run as the main program
# This script is a comprehensive example of how to use the `cryptography` library to encrypt and decrypt files and messages, as well as compress the output files. It's designed to be interactive, taking user input to determine the operation mode and then executing the appropriate function based on this input. The script also includes basic error handling for file operations and a simple mechanism for generating and using encryption keys. Remember, this script is meant for educational purposes and would need further modifications for use in a real-world application, especially in terms of security and error handling.
