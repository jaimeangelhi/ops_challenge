# Purpose:                      Create Python conditional statements
# Additional Source             ChatGPT

# Assign values to variables a and b
a = 10
b = 5

# Example 1: Using if and elif
if a == b:
    print("a is equal to b")
elif a > b:
    print("a is greater than b")
else:
    print("a is less than b")

# Example 2: Using different logical conditionals
if a != b:
    print("a is not equal to b")

if a < b:
    print("a is less than b")

if a <= b:
    print("a is less than or equal to b")

if a > b:
    print("a is greater than b")

if a >= b:
    print("a is greater than or equal to b")
